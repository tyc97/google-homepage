At first I grabbed the google image and formed the search bar
I created an unordered list for the navbar, listing links to said pages
in my styles.css I gave the lists an inline display to come out horizontal
there's unwanted space between the left of the page and where the About list displays,
I figured that adding 8px padding-left in my styles.css will fix it.
I wanted the links to be underlined on hover, I tried addressing that in my li a:hover style
